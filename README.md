# EvientsCore
An extremly simple-to-use plugin for managing Minecraft events without hassle.
## Installation
In the "Releases", download the latest version and simply add it to your plguins folder
## Usage
You can always check the `/help evientscore` command, but here is a list of basic commands within this plugin.

In EvientsCore, there are "selectors": `all`, `dead`, `alive`, `random`, `randomalive`, `randomdead`.  
Commands can have all of these or some of them:

- `/tpall` `/tpdead` `/tpalive` `/tprandomalive`, etc. This will tp the players that the selector has matched.
- `/reviveall` `/reviverandom`

When these types of commands are used, they will say in chat who was selected.
